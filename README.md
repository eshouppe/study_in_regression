A study in core regression methods.  My starting list of regression methods:
* Multiple linear regression
* Poisson regression
* Logistic regression
* Ridge regression
* LASSO regression
* Pick from kernel / polynomial / piecewise regression
* Time series regressio

I created this list by surveying several popular online tutorials or books in machine learning methods. These methods were repeatedly mentioned.
The list is subject to change. The most likely change is time series regression, which really refers to a collection of methods, and will likely be included in a Study in Time Series sequence in my future.

My goals with this project are twofold.
* Develop expert fluency with each regression modeling, with special focus on the bias/variance tradeoff, model selection, and model performance measurement
* Create a full stack data analysis software with:
...Simple but responsive front-end built out from Google's web starter kit
...Routing with Python Flask
...Python services layer
...Database TBD but likely MongoDB
...Deploy Flask on Cherrypy WSGI-compliant server

More update to come!
