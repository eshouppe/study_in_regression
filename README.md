A study in core regression methods.  My starting list of regression methods:
* OLS and polynomial multiple linear regression
* Poisson regression
* Logistic regression
* Ridge / LASSO regression
* Spline / piecewise regression
* Kernel / Gaussian process regression

I created this list by surveying several popular online tutorials or books in machine learning methods. These methods were repeatedly mentioned. The list is subject to change.

My goals with this project are twofold.
* Develop expert fluency with each regression modeling, with special focus on the bias/variance tradeoff, model selection, visualization, and model performance measurement

* Create a full stack data analysis software with:

  * Simple but responsive front-end  
  * Routing with Python Flask  
  * Python services layer  
  * Database TBD but likely MongoDB  
  * Deploy Flask on Cherrypy WSGI-compliant server  

More update to come!
